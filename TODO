write teh codez!


* Move subfunctions of test_omp_thm2 to regular .m files so we can use them in other routines.

* rename test_recovery to plot_recovery or something, so we know that a plot is going to pop up

* make a function that returns a Boolean value for whether or not the signal was correctly recovered
   - use 2-norm for recovery metric?
   - what is a good cut-off for when the signal is recovered?

* whenever we're making plots for the report, we can use matlab2tikz:
   - http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022-matlab2tikz
   - It'll be the most beautiful thing you've ever seen.
