* make a function that returns a Boolean value for whether or not the signal was correctly recovered
   - use 2-norm for recovery metric?
   - what is a good cut-off for when the signal is recovered?

* The value of N in Theorem 2 of Tropp 2007 is quite large; I believe that Tropp et al. discussed _much_ smaller values of N in Tropp 2007.
