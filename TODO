* whenever we're making plots for the report, we can use matlab2tikz:

   - It'll be the most beautiful thing you've ever seen.

* check_recovery.m - check if the approximate signal is a good 
      approximation to original signal
   - We currently use inf-norm; should we use 2-norm for recovery metric?  
   - we currently use 10^(-14) in each component; what is a good cut-off
      for when the signal is recovered?

* Recreate Figures 1,2 from Tropp 2007
   - tropp_fig1_* is implemented, but takes a while to compute.
   - do some matlab2tikz stuff

* matlab's qrinsert routine is implemented in pretty much pure matlab script; we should be able to get a significant performance improvement if we use C++ or Fortran... or we could just dealwithit.jpg.  Could use a parfor on the innermost loop of tropp_fig1_comp.m
